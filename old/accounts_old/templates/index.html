                    <p>This is an open-source project, built using open source technologies!</p> 
                    <p>Register with us, and join a steadily growing online community of developers who are commited to collaboration and innovation.</p>
                    <p>You can utilise the Unicorn Attractors issue tracker to register bugs and request additional features to be added to the site.</p>
                    <p>To register a bug will cost nothing, but in order for a new feature to be added to the site, we will charge a small (but fair) fee.</p>
                    <p>If enough funding can be raised for the additional feature to be worthwhile to work on, we promise to spend a minimum of 50% of our weekly development time working on developing the highest paid feature.</p>
                    <p>To add a feature request is free! To vote for a feature request will cost a small amount of money.</p>
